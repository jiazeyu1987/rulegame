# Task: Authentication Model Unit Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive unit tests for all authentication-related database models including User, Recorder, Doctor, and Patient models. Test model relationships, data validation, constraints, password hashing, and all CRUD operations. Ensure 100% coverage of model-level authentication functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete unit tests for User model (creation, validation, password hashing)
- [ ] Unit tests for Recorder model and User relationship
- [ ] Unit tests for Doctor model and User relationship  
- [ ] Unit tests for Patient model and family relationships
- [ ] Password hashing and verification testing
- [ ] Model constraint validation testing
- [ ] Database relationship integrity testing
- [ ] Data validation and error handling testing
- [ ] Model method testing (authentication-related methods)
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage for all authentication models

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: pytest with SQLAlchemy testing utilities
- **Models**: User, Recorder, Doctor, Patient models
- **Testing Patterns**: Model factory patterns for test data generation
- **Coverage**: All authentication-related model methods and properties
- **Validation**: Field validation, constraints, and business rules
- **Security**: Password hashing algorithms and secure storage validation

## Dependencies
- Task 10: Test Infrastructure Setup
- Existing authentication models in app/models/
- SQLAlchemy testing utilities
- Test database setup

## Deliverables
- `unittest/login/backend/test_models.py` with comprehensive model tests
- Model factory classes for test data generation
- Password security validation test suite
- Model relationship testing suite
- Data integrity and constraint testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication models have comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Password hashing and verification thoroughly tested
- [ ] Model relationships validated with proper foreign key constraints
- [ ] Data validation rules tested with valid/invalid inputs
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage achieved for authentication models
- [ ] All tests pass consistently with no flaky behavior

## Notes
Focus on security-critical aspects like password hashing, validation rules, and data integrity. These model tests form the foundation for all higher-level authentication testing.
